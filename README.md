# GPT from Scratch (Character-Level Language Model)  This project is an educational implementation of a **GPT-like Transformer language model** from scratch using **PyTorch**.   It follows the ideas from **Attention is All You Need (Vaswani et al., 2017)** and **GPT-1 (Radford et al., 2018)**, trained on *The Wizard of Oz* text.
